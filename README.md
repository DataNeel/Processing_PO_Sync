# Processing_PO_Sync
Processing code that sends a PO sync signal to control the tempo of a Teenage Engineering Pocket Operator


This repository contains some example code to show you how you can control the tempo of your [Pocket Operator](https://teenage.engineering/products/po) using [Processing](https://processing.org/).

For this code to work, you'll need to install the [Sound](https://processing.org/reference/libraries/sound/index.html) library for processing.
